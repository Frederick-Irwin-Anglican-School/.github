# Support for FIAS projects

This document outlines the default support options for all users.

## General notes

- Please check the project's [Issues](/issues) and Wiki (if available). Your issue may have already been raised and/or addressed.
- If your issue hasn't been raised, please provide as much information as possible when raising a new issue. Detailed steps to repdocuce and screenshots are a great way to ensure that we can resolve your issue quickly.
- If the project you're having issues with generates a log file, please include the logs when submitting the ticket. We can often pinpoint the issue by reading the logs.

## Internal users (staff and students at FIAS, invited external users)

Please submit a `Feature Request` or `Bug Report` via the projects [Issues](/issues) section. Please provide as much information as possible; vague requests waste everyone's time, and mean that your issue cannot be resolved as fast as we'd like.

## External users

Please contact ithelpdesk@fias.wa.edu.au with a detailed description of your issue.
